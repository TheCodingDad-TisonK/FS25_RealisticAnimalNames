# FS25 Realistic Animal Names - Roadmap

This roadmap provides a **strategic plan** for the mod’s development.  
Developers and AI should use this as a **timeline and prioritization guide** when implementing features.

---

## Phase 1 - Immediate Improvements (High Priority)
- Ensure **name persistence** and **multiplayer sync** are robust.
- Improve **UI for naming animals**:
  - Batch renaming
  - Sorting and filtering
  - Intuitive, responsive controls
- Add **basic dynamic display options**:
  - Adjustable text size, color, style
  - Distance and camera visibility toggles

---

## Phase 2 - Extended Features (Medium Priority)
- Add **advanced search and filtering** for large herds.
- Implement **per-player visibility toggles** in multiplayer.
- Provide a **mod API** for programmatic access to animal names and metadata.
- Optimize performance for farms with **large numbers of animals**.

---

## Phase 3 - Community & Customization (Medium/Long-Term)
- Support **community-contributed name packs** (themes, languages, farm-specific sets).
- Implement **showcase or leaderboard** for creative animal naming.
- Add **localization support** for non-English players.
- Expand UI customization options (fonts, colors, iconography).

---

## Phase 4 - Future Enhancements / Experimental (Optional)
- Track **animal metadata**: breed, age, traits, or health stats.
- Add **random name generator** with localization and themed sets.
- Integrate seamlessly with other realism mods (e.g., reproduction, genetics, animal tracking mods).
- Introduce **in-game achievements or badges** for naming milestones or complete herds.

---

### Notes for Developers / AI
- Follow the **VISION.md principles** when implementing features.
- Prioritize features that **enhance immersion, maintain multiplayer compatibility, and avoid performance issues**.
- Always design with **future integration and community contributions** in mind.
