# FS25 Realistic Animal Names - Vision

## 🌟 Project Vision

**FS25_RealisticAnimalNames** is a mod for *Farming Simulator 25* that brings **personalization and immersion** to animal management. In real-life farming, each animal is identifiable and has its own personality; this mod aims to replicate that experience in-game by giving animals **unique names displayed as floating tags**, making the player’s farm feel alive.

### Key Principles
1. **Immersion First**
   - Every feature should enhance the feeling that players are managing a real farm.
   - Animal names should be **visible, readable, and contextually appropriate**, without cluttering the screen.

2. **Lightweight & Performance-Friendly**
   - Floating name tags and UI should not affect game performance.
   - The mod should run smoothly in **single-player and multiplayer** settings, even with large herds.

3. **Multiplayer Compatibility**
   - Names must **sync correctly between players**.
   - Conflicts, such as two players renaming the same animal, should be handled gracefully.
   - Players can optionally **hide or show names** based on preference.

4. **Customization & Flexibility**
   - Players should be able to choose name display options (size, color, visibility distance).
   - Names should **persist across save/load cycles** and be stored in a way that integrates seamlessly with the game’s save system.
   - Future expansions could include metadata like breed, age, and personality traits.

5. **Community & Mod Integration**
   - The mod should be **easy to extend**, allowing other mods to interact with animal names.
   - Encourage a **community-driven ecosystem**: players contributing name packs, translations, or themed collections.
   - Maintain a clear API for developers who want to integrate or enhance functionality.

### Long-Term Vision
- Become the **standard naming and animal personalization system** for FS25.
- Serve as a foundation for **advanced realism mods**, enabling mods that track genetics, reproduction, or animal statistics while maintaining the personalized experience.
- Create a **player-first experience**: fun, intuitive, and satisfying to interact with animals in a way that feels meaningful.

### 👩‍💻 How Developers / AI Should Use This Vision
- Use this vision as the **guiding principle for all new features, bug fixes, and enhancements**.
- Any addition should **enhance immersion**, maintain **performance**, and **support multiplayer**.
- Prioritize **user experience and accessibility** — the mod should be simple enough for casual players but flexible for advanced users.
- When designing features, consider **future expansion and integration** with other mods.
